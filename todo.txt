Development hit list for 1.0:

libvorbis:

libvorbis isn't doing the 'how much data in the last frame' trick from
the PCM counter/last page flag.

Implement correct truncated packet handling; this is mostly a case of
'intiialize vectors and check return values' in res0.c:inverse (but
not entirely)

Meaningful error code returns

Option for brute-forcing vq search on maptype 2 (helps on undertrained
sets).

API changes: 
  break up some of the more monolithic calls (eg, allow access
       to MDCT domain data, additional low level framing capability)
  convenience calls for text comments

other:

command line suite
