Ogg Vorbis I format specification: residue setup and decode
</font></h1>

<em>Last update to this document: July 18, 2002</em><br>

<h1>Overview</h1>

A residue vector represents the fine detail of the audio spectrum of
one channel in an audio frame after the encoder subtracts the floor
curve and performs any channel coupling.  A residue vector may
represent spectral lines, spectral magnitude, spectral phase or
hybrids as mixed by channel coupling.  The exact semantic content of
the vector does not matter to the residue abstraction.<p>

Whatever the exact qualities, the Vorbis residue abstraction codes the
residue vectors into the bitstream packet, and then reconstructs the
vectors during decode.  Vorbis makes use of three different encoding
variants (numbered 0, 1 and 2) of the same basic vector encoding
abstration.<p>

<h1>Residue format</h1>

Reside format takes the bundles of vectors, partitions the vectors
into chunks, classifies each chunk, encodes the chunk classifications
and finally encodes the chunks using the the specific VQ arrangement
defined for each selected selected classification.  The exact
interleaving and partitioning vary by residue encoding number, however
the high-level process used to classify and encode the residue vector
is the same in all three variants.<p>

A set of coded residue vectors are all of the same length.  High level
coding structure, ignoring for the moment exactly how a partition is
encoded and simply trusting that it is, is as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li>Each vector is partitioned into multiple equal sized chunks
according to configuration specified.  If we have a vector size of
<i>n</i>, a partition size <i>residue_partition_size</i>, and a total
of <i>ch</i> residue vectors, the total number of paritioned chunks
coded is <i>n</i>/<i>residue_partition_size</i>*<i>ch</i>.  It is
important to note that the integer division truncates.  In the below
example, we assume an example <i>residue_partition_size</i> of 8.<p>

<li>Each partition in each vector has a classification number that
specifies which of multiple configured VQ codebook setups are used to
decode that partition.  The classification numbers of each partition
can be thought of as forming a vector, as in the illustration below.
Just as the residue vectors are coded in grouped partitions to
increase encoding efficiency, the classification vector is also
partitioned into chunks.  The integer elements of each scalar in a
classification chunk are built into a single scalar that represents
the classification numbers in that chunk.  In the below example, the
classification codeword encodes two classification numbers.<p>

<li>The values in a residue vector may be encoded monolithically in a
single pass through the residue vector, but more often efficient
codebook design dictates that each vector is encoded as the additive
sum of several passes through the residue vector using more than one
VQ codebook.  Thus, each residue value potentially accumulates values
from multiple decode passes.  The classification value associated with
a partition is the same in each pass, thus the classification codeword
is coded only in the first pass.<p>

</ul>

<h2>residue 0</h2>

Residue 0 and 1 differ only in the way the values within a residue
partition are interleaved during partition encoding (visually treated
as a black box- or cyan box or brown box- in the above figure).<p>

Residue encoding 0 interleaves VQ encoding according to the
dimension of the codebook used to encode a partition in a specific
pass.  The dimension of the codebook need not be the same in multiple
passes, however the partition size must be an even multiple of the
codebook dimension.<p>

As an example, assume a partition vector of size eight, to be encoded
by residue 0 using codebook sizes of 8, 4, 2 and 1:<p>

<pre>

            original residue vector: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 8  encoded as: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 4  encoded as: [ 0 2 4 6 ], [ 1 3 5 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 2  encoded as: [ 0 4 ], [ 1 5 ], [ 2 6 ], [ 3 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 1  encoded as: [ 0 ], [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ], [ 6 ], [ 7 ]

</pre>

It is worth mentioning at this point that no configurable value in the
residue coding setup is restricted to a power of two.<p>

<h2> residue 1 </h2>

Residue 1 does not interleave VQ encoding.  It represents partition
vector scalars in order.  As with residue 0, however, partition length
must be an integer multiple of the codebook dimension, although
dimension may vary from pass to pass.

As an example, assume a partition vector of size eight, to be encoded
by residue 0 using codebook sizes of 8, 4, 2 and 1:<p>

<pre>

            original residue vector: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 8  encoded as: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 4  encoded as: [ 0 1 2 3 ], [ 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 2  encoded as: [ 0 1 ], [ 2 3 ], [ 4 5 ], [ 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 1  encoded as: [ 0 ], [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ], [ 6 ], [ 7 ]

</pre>

<h2> residue 2 </h2>

Residue type two can be thought of as a variant of residue type 1.
Rather than encoding multiple passed-in vectors as in residue type 1,
the <i>ch</i> passed in vectors of length <i>n</i> are first
interleaved and flattened into a single vector of length
<i>ch</i>*<i>n</i>.  Encoding then proceeds as in type 1. Decoding is
as in type 1 with decode interleave reversed. If operating on a single
vector to begin with, residue type 1 and type 2 are equivalent.<p>

<h1>Residue decode</h1>

<h2>header decode</h2>

Header decode for all three residue types is identical.<p>
<pre>
  1) [residue_begin] = read 24 bits as unsigned integer
  2) [residue_end] = read 24 bits as unsigned integer
  3) [residue_partition_size] = read 24 bits as unsigned integer and add one
  4) [residue_classifications] = read 6 bits as unsigned integer and add one
  5) [residue_classbook] = read 8 bits as unsigned integer
</pre>

<tt>residue_begin</tt> and <tt>residue_end</tt> select the specific
subportion of each vector that is actually coded; it implements akin
to a bandpass where, for coding purposes, the vector effectively
begins at element <tt>residue_begin</tt> and ends at
<tt>residue_end</tt>.  Preceeding and following values in the unpacked
vectors are zeroed.  Note that for residue type 2, these values as
well as <tt>[residue_partition_size</tt>apply to the interleaved
vector, not the individual vectors before interleave.
<tt>residue_partition_size</tt> is as explained above,
<tt>residue_classifications</tt> is the number of possible
classification to which a partition can belong and
<tt>residue_classbook</tt> is the codebook number used to code
classification codewords.  The number of dimensions in book
<tt>residue_classbook</tt> determines how many classification values
are grouped into a single classification codeword.<p>

Next we read a bitmap pattern that specifies which partition classes
code values in which passes.<p>

<pre>
  1) iterate [i] over the range 0 ... [residue_classifications]-1 {
  
       2) [high_bits] = 0
       3) [low_bits] = read 3 bits as unsigned integer
       4) [bitflag] = read one bit as boolean
       5) if ( [bitflag] is set ) then [high_bits] = read five bits as unsigned integer
       6) vector [residue_cascade] element [i] = [high_bits] * 8 + [low_bits]
     }
  7) done
</pre>

Finally, we read in a list of book numbers, each corresponding to
specific bit set in the cascade bitmap.  We loop over the possible
codebook classifications and the maximum possible number of encoding
stages (8 in Vorbis I, as constrained by the elements of the cascade
bitmap being eight bits):<p>

<pre>
  1) iterate [i] over the range 0 ... [residue_classifications]-1 {
  
       2) iterate [j] over the range 0 ... 7 {
  
            3) if ( vector [residue_cascade] element [i] bit [j] is set ) {

                 4) array [residue_books] element [i][j] = read 8 bits as unsigned integer

               } else {

                 5) array [residue_books] element [i][j] = unused

               }
          }
      }

  6) done
</pre>

An end-of-packet condition at any point in header decode renders the
stream undecodable.  In addition, any codebook number greater than the
maximum numbered codebook set up in this stream also renders the
stream undecodable.<p>

<h2>packet decode</h2>

Format 0 and 1 packet decode is identical except for specific
partition interleave.  Format 2 packet decode can be built out of the
format 1 decode process.  Thus we describe first the decode
infrastructure identical to all three formats.<p>

The following convenience values are conceptually useful to clarifying
the decode process:<p>

<pre>
  1) [classvals_per_codeword] = [codebook_dimensions] value of codebook [residue_classbook]
  2) [n_to_read] = [residue_end] - [residue-begin]
  3) [partitions_to_read] = [n_to_read] / [residue_partition_size]
</pre>

Packet decode proceeds as follows, matching the description offered earlier in the document.  We assume that the number of vectors being encoded, <tt>[ch]</tt> is provided by the higher level decoding process.<p>  
<pre>
  1) allocate and zero all vectors that will be returned.
  2) iterate [pass] over the range 0 ... 7 {

       3) [partition_count] = 0
       4) if ([pass] is zero) {
     
            5) iterate [j] over the range 0 .. [ch]-1 {

                 6) [temp] = read from packet using codebook [residue_classbook] in scalar context
                 7) iterate [k] descending over the range [classvals_per_codeword]-1 ... 0 {

                      8) array [classifications] element [j],([partition_count]+[k]) =
                         [temp] integer modulo [residue_classifications]
                      9) [temp] = [temp] / [residue_classifications] using integer division

                    }
 
               }
            
          }

      10) [classword_count] = 0
      11) iterate [j] over the range 0 .. [ch]-1 {

            12) [vqclass] = array [classifications] element [j],([partition_count]+[classword_count])
            13) [vqbook] = array [residue_books] element [vqclass],[pass]
            14) if ([vqbook] is not 'unused') {

                  15) decode partition into output vector number [j], starting at scalar 
                      offset [residue_begin]+[partition_count]*[residue_partition_size] using 
                      codebook number [vqbook] in VQ context
                }
          }

      16) increment [classword_count]
      17) increment [partition_count]
      18) if ([classword_count] is less than [classvals_per_codeword]) AND 
             ([partition_count] is less than [partitions_to_read) then continue at step 11
      19) if ([partition_count] is less than [partitions_to_read) then continue at step 4
    }
 
 20) done

</pre>

An end-of-packet codition during packet decode is to be considered a
nominal occurence.  End-of-packet during a classification codeword
read halts decode immediately and returns the partially-decoded
packet.  If decode hits end-of-packet while reading a partition, the
partially decoded partition is discarded and decode returns the result
of vector decode up to that point.<p>
