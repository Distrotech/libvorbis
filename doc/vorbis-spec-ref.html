Ogg Vorbis I format specification: codec setup and packet decode
</font></h1>

<em>Last update to this document: July 18, 2002</em><br>

<h1>Overview</h1>

This document serves as the top-level reference document for the
bit-by-bit decode specification of Vorbis I.  This document assumes a
high-level understanding of the Vorbis decode process, which is
provided in the document <a href="vorbis-spec-intro.html">Ogg Vorbis I
format specification: introduction and description</a>.

<h1>Header decode and decode setup</h1>

A Vorbis bitstream begins with three header packets. The header
packets are, in order, the identification header, the comments header,
and the setup header. All are required for decode compliance.  An
end-of-packet condition during decoding the first or third header
packet renders the stream undecodable.  End-of-packet decoding the
comment header is a non-fatal error condition.<p>

<h2>Identification Header</h2>

The identification header is a short header of only a few fields used
to declare the stream definitively as Vorbis, and provide a externally
relevant pieces of information about the audio stream. The
identification header is coded as follows:<p>

<ol>
<li>



<h2>Comment Header</h2>

Comment header decode and data specification is covered in <a
href="v-comment.html">Ogg Vorbis I format specification: comment field
and header specification</a>.

<h2>Setup Header</h2>


<h3>mapping 0</h3>

<h4>channel order</h4>

In mapping type 0, channel mapping is implicitly defined as follows for standard audio applications:<p>

<dl>
<dt>one channel:<dd> the stream is monophonic
<dt>two channels:<dd> the stream is stereo.  channel order: left, right
<dt>three channels:<dd> the stream is a 1d-surround encoding.  channel order: left, center, right
<dt>four channels:<dd> the stream is quadraphonic surround.  channel order: front left, front right, rear left, rear right
<dt>five channels:<dd> the stream is five-channel surround.  channel order: front left, front center, front right, rear left, rear right
<dt>six channels:<dd> the stream is 5,1 surround.  channel order: front left, front center, front right, rear left, rear right, LFE
<dt>greter than six channels:<dd> channel use and order is defined by the application
</dl>

Applications using vorbis for dedicated purposes may define channel
mapping as seen fit.  Future channel mappings (such as three and four
channel <a href="http://www.ambisonic.net">Ambisonics</a>) will make
use of channel mappings other than mapping 0.
