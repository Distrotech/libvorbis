 function: build a VQ codebook

/* This code is *not* part of libvorbis.  It is used to generate
   trained codebooks offline and then spit the results into a
   pregenerated codebook that is compiled into libvorbis.  It is an
   expensive (but good) algorithm.  Run it on big iron. */

/* There are so many optimizations to explore in *both* stages that
   considering the undertaking is almost withering.  For now, we brute
   force it all */

/* Codebook generation happens in two steps: 

   1) Train the codebook with data collected from the encoder: We use
   one of a few error metrics (which represent the distance between a
   given data point and a candidate point in the training set) to
   divide the training set up into cells representing roughly equal
   probability of occurring. 

   2) Generate the codebook and auxiliary data from the trained data set
*/

/* Codebook training ****************************************************
 *
 * The basic idea here is that a VQ codebook is like an m-dimensional
 * foam with n bubbles.  The bubbles compete for space/volume and are
 * 'pressurized' [biased] according to some metric.  The basic alg
 * iterates through allowing the bubbles to compete for space until
 * they converge (if the damping is dome properly) on a steady-state
 * solution. Individual input points, collected from libvorbis, are
 * used to train the algorithm monte-carlo style.  */
