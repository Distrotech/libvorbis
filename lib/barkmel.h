/* The bark scale equations are approximations, since the original
   table was somewhat hand rolled.  They're chosen to have the best
   possible fit to the rolled tables, thus their somewhat odd
   appearence (these are more accurate and over a longer range than
   the oft-quoted bark equations found in the texts I have).  The
   approximations are valid from 0 - 30kHz (nyquist) or so.
