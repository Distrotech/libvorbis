In order to compile sucessfully the correct path to libogg
must be set in libogg.vsprops.

Lets say you have libogg and libvorbis in the same directory:

libogg-1.1.3 
libvorbis-1.2.0

you should open libogg.vsprops with a text editor (even notepad.exe
will suffice) and see if LIBOGG_VERSION is set to the correct
version, in this case "1.1.3"
