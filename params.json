Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other\r\nproprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the\r\nmonth), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.\r\nAll the technical details are published and documented, and any\r\nsoftware entity may make full use of the format without license \r\nfee, royalty or patent concerns.\r\n\r\nThis package contains:\r\n\r\n* libvorbis, a BSD-style license software implementation of\r\n  the Vorbis specification by the Xiph.Org Foundation \r\n  (http://www.xiph.org/) \r\n\r\n* libvorbisfile, a BSD-style license convenience library\r\n  built on Vorbis designed to simplify common uses\r\n\r\n* libvorbisenc, a BSD-style license library that provides a simple,\r\n  programmatic encoding setup interface \r\n\r\n* example code making use of libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile and\r\n  libvorbisenc\r\n\r\nWHAT'S HERE:\r\n\r\nThis source distribution includes libvorbis and an example\r\nencoder/player to demonstrate use of libvorbis as well as\r\ndocumentation on the Ogg Vorbis audio coding format.\r\n\r\nYou'll need libogg (distributed separately) to compile this library.\r\nA more comprehensive set of utilities is available in the vorbis-tools\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nDirectory:\r\n\r\n./lib  \t\tThe source for the libraries, a BSD-license implementation\r\n\t\tof the public domain Ogg Vorbis audio encoding format.\r\n\r\n./include       Library API headers\r\n\r\n./debian        Rules/spec files for building Debian .deb packages\r\n\r\n./doc           Vorbis documentation\r\n\r\n./examples\tExample code illustrating programmatic use of libvorbis, \r\n\t\tlibvorbisfile and libvorbisenc\r\n\r\n./mac \t\tCodewarrior project files and build tweaks for MacOS.\r\n\r\n./macosx \tProject files for MacOS X.\r\n\r\n./win32\t\tWin32 projects files and build automation\r\n\r\n./vq \t\tInternal utilities for training/building new LSP/residue \r\n\t\tand auxiliary codebooks.\r\n\r\nCONTACT:\r\n\r\nThe Ogg homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/'.\r\nVorbis's homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/'.\r\nUp to date technical documents, contact information, source code and\r\npre-built utilities may be found there.\r\n\r\nThe user website for Ogg Vorbis software and audio is http://vorbis.com/\r\n\r\nBUILDING FROM TRUNK:\r\n\r\nDevelopment source is under subversion revision control at \r\nhttps://svn.xiph.org/trunk/vorbis/. You will also need the \r\nnewest versions of autoconf, automake, libtool and pkg-config in\r\norder to compile Vorbis from development source. A configure script\r\nis provided for you in the source tarball distributions.\r\n\r\n  [update or checkout latest source]\r\n  ./autogen.sh\r\n  make\r\n\r\nand as root if desired:\r\n\r\n  make install\r\n\r\nThis will install the Vorbis libraries (static and shared) into\r\n/usr/local/lib, includes into /usr/local/include and API manpages\r\n(once we write some) into /usr/local/man.\r\n\r\nDocumentation building requires xsltproc and pdfxmltex.\r\n\r\nBUILDING FROM TARBALL DISTRIBUTIONS:\r\n\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n\r\nand optionally (as root):\r\n  make install\r\n\r\nBUILDING RPMS:\r\n\r\nafter normal configuring:\r\n\r\n  make dist\r\n  rpm -ta libvorbis-<version>.tar.gz\r\n\r\nBUILDING ON MACOS 9:\r\n\r\nVorbis on MacOS 9 is built using Metroworks CodeWarrior.  To build it, \r\nfirst verify that the Ogg libraries are already built following the\r\ninstructions in the Ogg module README.  Open vorbis/mac/libvorbis.mcp,\r\nswitch to the \"Targets\" pane, select everything, and make the project.\r\nDo the same thing to build libvorbisenc.mcp, and libvorbisfile.mcp (in\r\nthat order).  In vorbis/mac/Output you will now have both debug and final\r\nversions of Vorbis shared libraries to link your projects against.\r\n\r\nTo build a project using Ogg Vorbis, add access paths to your\r\nCodeWarrior project for the ogg/include, ogg/mac/Output,\r\nvorbis/include, and vorbis/mac/Output folders.  Be sure that\r\n\"interpret DOS and Unix paths\" is turned on in your project; it can\r\nbe found in the \"access paths\" pane in your project settings.  Now\r\nsimply add the shared libraries you need to your project (OggLib and\r\nVorbisLib at least) and #include \"ogg/ogg.h\" and \"vorbis/codec.h\"\r\nwherever you need to access Ogg and Vorbis functionality.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
