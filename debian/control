Description: Development library for OGG Vorbis
 Ogg Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
 general-purpose compressed audio format for high quality (44.1-48.0kHz,
 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and variable bitrates 
 from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis in the same class as 
 audio representations including MPEG-1 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 
 audio (AAC and TwinVQ), and PAC.
