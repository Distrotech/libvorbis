Ogg Vorbis for Debian
---------------------

Ogg Vorbis currently does not have a shared library. it is a goal for the
future, but presently, any compiling using the codec should be done as
follows:

	gcc [flags] -c X.c
	gcc [flags] /usr/lib/vorbisfile.a /usr/lib/libvorbis.a \
		X.o -o X

Of course, only include the .a's that are required for your program.
